## How to Use

### REST API endpoints

This table describes our REST API "endpoints" - these are the URLs that will define how we can perform operations on our sqlite3 database.

| # | Endpoints                                             | HTTP Method | Description                                 |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1 | http://localhost:5000/api/pokemon                     | GET         | Get the list of all Pokemon in the database |
| 2 | http://localhost:5000/api/pokemon/<pokedex_no>        | GET         | Get a single Pokemon by its Pokedex no.     |
| 3 | http://localhost:5000/api/pokemon/add                 | POST        | Create a new Pokemon record                 |
| 4 | http://localhost:5000/api/pokemon/update              | PUT         | Update a Pokemon record                     |
| 5 | http://localhost:5000/api/pokemon/delete/<pokedex_no> | DELETE      | Delete a Pokemon record                     |

### Setup on UVM Silk

As currently implemented, getting this program to work on UVM's Silk server is a bit of a pain. This might be improved in the future, but it's what we've got for now. Here is what you need to do:
1. In Silk, create a directory called `api` withing your `www-root` directory (so that you have `api/www-root`).
2. Within the `api` directory, create the following files/directories:
   1. my_api.py
   2. public/
   3. wsgi.py
3. For each route (URL) that you wish to set up, you need to create a route in my_api.py. Contained within this repository is an example using Pokemon data.
4. Once you have your routes set up, edit `www-root/.silk.ini` with each route. Again, an example of my `.silk.ini` for this Pokemon example can be found within this repository.
5. Once you have your routes added to `.silk.ini`, run the following command from `www-root` on Silk: `silk site <url> update`. For <url>, simply insert the URL you wish to use. I just used `<netid>.w3.uvm.edu`.
6. Finally, run `silk app <url>/<path> load # for uri = /<path>` ***FOR EACH*** path you set up. You cannot run this command only once, or you will get 404 errors.
7. You are all setâ€”your site should work as designed. Please note that, in my example, the POST and PUT requests require data to be supplied in JSON form in the request body. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is an excellent tool for this.

#### Sample Pokemon object
```json
pokemon = {
    "name": "Houndoom",
    "type1": "dark",
    "type2": "fire",
    "generation": 2,
    "abilities": [
                    'Early Bird',
                    'Flash Fire',
                    'Unnerve'
                 ]
}
```
